***Important Notes:***

> [!CAUTION]
> Please be aware when using Scorpion, You may experience bugs with LuaArmor and may get blacklisted from scripts that use it.


> [!IMPORTANT]
- ‚ùì Scorpion's main-purpose is to increase the stability of your exploit by maxing it's environment to the max!
 
- üìÇ With Scorpion: You can gain over 87-88% UNC and 90-91% RENC, (whatever in that case...)
     Guaranteed and people like Salad (insaladarel) who helped me make most of the functions
 
- ‚öôÔ∏è Including a built-in ByteCode LuaU Interpeter, Fiu, and giving you the most access (already) within Roblox's Services automatically.
   Instead of using game:GetService, we use FindService for better reserves and faster loading.
 
- üíª With smooth-built-in animations using TweenService, We can guarantee NO FPS drops with using Scorpion!

- üìú Including a Decompiler, Konstant. Using plusgiant5's Module, and bytecode compressing improvements built in.
  Decompiling Scripts on Dex Explorer

- üíâ With Scorpion's Dev Console, it is assured on what actions the Executor is doing, such as
   Attaching, Executing, Clearing the TextBox, etc.

- üìë Powerful Custom Functions
   Scorpion includes a full-side documentation about our library, We included all the useful ones below.



# Does it include a documentation?

- Yes, it does! You can view it right  [here.](https://github.com/RazAPI/Scorpion/blob/main/Documentation.md)
- If you're interested, here are some custom functions that can be used. (Over-powered, and boring...)

 ```lua
 scr.get_address(getrunningscripts) -- As an example, this will print out the original address of the function.
 scr.protect_script -- Protects a script inside CoreGui, or for example it could be used in PlayerGui.
 scr.protect_gui -- Parents to Scorpion Container
 scr.setnilinstance -- Sets an instance's parent to nil.
 scr.killinstance -- Destroys an instance
 scr.findnilinstances -- Finds all nil instances, basically like getnilinstances but it'll only search for ModuleScripts
 scr.ctable -- Create a table, for no reason.
 scr.get_closure -- Returns the main closure
 scr.getsignal -- By using HttpService, and BrowserService, it'll try to get your original User-Agent (Device, IOS, Windows, Android).
 scr.filetable -- Prints out all file system functions
 
 ```
# Why?

- I genuinely have no idea why i've made this, i was bored to the point this was actually supposed to be a hub.
- I just thought: No, I want to do something more than that.

  # Has it released? Where can i get it?

  - Scorpion has still **not** released, because it is currently in a rewriting stage.
  - Asking again, Does scorpion have a website?
 
  - Yes, Scorpion indeed does have a website. You can check it down below.
