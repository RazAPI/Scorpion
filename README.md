If you are hereby viewing the source, you are not allowed to take any permissable holdings of the environment-boosters in the source

***Scorpion includes features like:***


*⚙️ A built-in Lua Bytecode Interpeter, going by Fiu. ⚙️*

*🎮 With 84%-83% UNC, you can experience the best and stablest execution experience in the history of Roblox Exploiting. 🎮*


*💉 Within the UNC part, Scorpion includes over 86% RENC apart from our powerful functions guided. 💉*

*💰 Scorpion includes some parts of Init scripts, which were made by insaladarel on discord. 💰*

*⚠️ With the always-updated Decompiler, using plusgiant5's Konstant Decompiler, it comes to enhance your experiencing on decompiling scripts in Dex. ⚠️*


*📑 UI Animations: Animations included like pressing on the X button, all UI elements will fade away, Hovering over buttons which will make them have a increased size, or position in the front. 📑*





Think this out: sUNC does not really like Lua-Built functions, meaning we obviously don't have alot on our plate.

Read this: This internal is only perfect for Solara, and other environments for other executors will be detected eitherway, Wait for another update.

This was just made for fun, and i expect nothing from it since all i want is just for it to act like a normal lua-built internal.
