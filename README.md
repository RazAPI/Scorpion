***Important Notes:***

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Scorpion's main-purpose is to increase the stability of your exploit by maxing it's environment to the max!
> With Scorpion: You can gain over 85% UNC and 89% RENC, (whatever in that case...)

> With smooth-built-in animations using TweenService, We can guarantee NO FPS drops with using Scorpion!

# Does it include a documentation?

- Yes, it does! You can view it right  [here.](https://github.com/RazAPI/Scorpion/blob/main/Documentation.md)
- If you're interested, here are some custom functions that can be used. (Over-powered, and boring...)

 ```lua
 scr.get_address(getrunningscripts) -- As an example, this will print out the original address of the function.
 scr.protect_script -- Protects a script inside CoreGui, or for example it could be used in PlayerGui.
 scr.protect_gui -- Parents to Scorpion Container
 scr.setnilinstance -- Sets an instance's parent to nil.
 scr.killinstance -- Destroys an instance
 scr.findnilinstances -- Finds all nil instances, basically like getnilinstances but it'll only search for ModuleScripts
 scr.ctable -- Create a table, for no reason.
 ```
# Why?

- I genuinely have no idea why i've made this, i was bored to the point this was actually supposed to be a hub.
- I just thought: No, I want to do something more than that.

  # Has it released? Where can i get it?

  - Scorpion has still **not** released, because it is currently in a rewriting stage.
  - Asking again, Does scorpion have a website?
 
  - Yes, Scorpion indeed does have a website. You can check it down below.
