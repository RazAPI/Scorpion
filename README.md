# Why?

- I genuinely have no idea why i've made this, i was bored to the point this was actually supposed to be a hub.
- I just thought: No, I want to do something more than that.

  # Has it released? Where can i get it?

  - Scorpion has still **not** released, because it is currently in a rewriting stage.
  - Asking again, Does scorpion have a website?
 
  - Yes, Scorpion indeed does have a website. You can check it down below.
